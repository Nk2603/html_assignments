    <h2><b>Question 3:</b>What are the  technologies used in full stack</h2><hr>
    <p><b>Answer:</b>Full-stack development involves creating both the frontend (user-facing) and backend (server-side) components of applications. Itâ€™s a holistic approach that encompasses the entire application stack. Here are some key technologies used in full-stack development:<br><br><hr>

        1.<b>Frontend Technologies:</b><br>
        HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.<br>
        CSS: Used for styling and layout of web pages.<br>
        JavaScript: A versatile scripting language for adding interactivity to web applications.<br>
        <b>Frameworks and Libraries:</b> These include popular tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js for building dynamic user interfaces.<br><br><hr>
        2.<b>Backend Technologies:</b><br>
        Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side scripting.<br>
        Python: Widely used for backend development due to its simplicity and readability.<br>
        Java: Known for its robustness and scalability.<br>
        Ruby: Often used with the Ruby on Rails framework.<br>
        PHP: Commonly used for web applications.<br>
        Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js framework for building APIs and web applications.<br>
        Django: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development.<br>
        Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.<br><br><hr>
        3.<b>Database Technologies:</b><br>
        SQL: Structured Query Language for managing relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).<br>
        NoSQL: Non-relational databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, or Redis.<br><hr>
        Remember, full-stack developers need to be proficient in both frontend and backend technologies, allowing them to build complete applications independently and ensure seamless integration
